# Vectors 
```{r}
# Creating a vector
dogs <- c("teddy", "khora", "waffle", "banjo", "tallie")

# Check the class
class(dogs)
```
```{r}
# Creating vector with different classes
cat <- c("creamsicle wolf", 14.2, 3L)

# Vector with different classes is a character bec. it's the most flexible
class(cat)
```
```{r}
# Using typeof() to further check class
years <- c(20, 40, 16, 2)
class(years)
typeof(years)
```

```{r}
# Want to do a conditional check
# is. <<< asks question "is this THIS"
# as. <<< gives command "make this THIS"

#Asking if years numeric
is.numeric(years)

#Asking if years charecter
is.character(years)
```

# Named vector of elements
```{r}
#note this continues to be a 1-D vector
#almost giving a column name to this 
dog_food <- c(teddy = "purina", khora = "alpo", waffle = "fancy feast")
dog_food
dog_food[2]

#can also call things where its looking for that item in the vector
dog_food["khora"]
```
